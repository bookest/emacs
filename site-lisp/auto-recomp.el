;;; Commentary:

;; This file allows you to set up Emacs Lisp files to be automatically
;; byte-compiled whenever they are saved.  Mark such files by giving
;; them a local variable named `auto-recompile' set to a non-nil
;; value.  See the Emacs Manual for how to make file local variables.
;; Then, if this file is loaded, whenever such a file is saved it will
;; be byte-compiled.

;;; Code:

(defvar auto-recompile nil
  "Automatically byte-recompile this file whenever it is saved.")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'auto-recompile)

(defun auto-recompile-file-maybe ()
  (when auto-recompile
    (byte-compile-file buffer-file-name)))

(defun add-after-save-hook ()
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'auto-recompile-file-maybe))

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'add-after-save-hook)

(provide 'auto-recomp)
